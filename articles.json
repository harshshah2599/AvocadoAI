We\u2019ve asked Dr. Naureen Whittinger, Senior Clinical Psychologist at the London NHS Foundation Trust, what to expect from the first visit, how to prepare for it, and how soon you\u2019ll see results. Interview has been edited for clarity. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for any formal preparation before attending your first appointment,\u201d Dr. Whittinger says. However, she suggests thinking about what you are hoping to gain from therapy and how you might tell your therapist about this: \u201cMake sure you are clear about what your therapist can offer you and write down any questions you might have about the therapy ahead of time.\u201d\u00a0 Aside from that, Dr. Whittinger advises simply to relax about your session. It\u2019s your therapist\u2019s job to work alongside you to better understand your difficulties and to consider how you might work towards your goals. Not all therapies are the same. Dr. Whittinger says, \u201cSome types of therapy, such as couples and family therapy, are helpful for understanding and resolving problems in relationships. These typically involve attending with the other people in your life. This type of therapy works best when everyone involved is happy to attend and prepared to work towards the same goals.\u201d \u201cYour first appointment is a chance for you and your psychological therapist to learn more about each other and how therapy might be helpful for you. This appointment gives your therapist a chance to explain more about how therapy works and gather more detailed information from you about any current difficulties,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger.\u00a0 Your therapist will let you know when the session is over and may give you some homework or formulate a plan for your next session with you at the end of the session.

Dr. Whittinger also says that psychological therapists usually have a professional supervisor who they might consult on your case, but this supervisor would also be bound to keep your information confidential. \u201cThe other exception is if you have told the therapist something that gives them serious concerns about your safety or the safety of others. In this case, your therapist has a duty to act to protect you and others from harm.\u201d Your therapist might take notes during or after the session. These notes usually won\u2019t be shared with anyone outside of your therapy, with a few exceptions. \u201cIn the rare circumstance that your notes are requested by the police or a court of law, your therapist would usually tell you,\u201d Dr. Whittinger explains.\u00a0 Your psychological therapist will ask you questions about your life and what has brought you to therapy. \u201cThey should pay attention to you during sessions and be sensitive to your beliefs and culture,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger. And Dr. Whittinger also shares some things that a therapist shouldn\u2019t do: \u201cIf your therapist does any of these, you might want to raise your concerns with them or their therapy practice,\u201d Dr. Whittinger suggests.\u00a0 \u201cA good therapist will be open to your feedback and will want to rectify their mistakes.

To learn what we do to deliver the best health and lifestyle insights to you, check out our content review principles. For most women, an upcoming period usually brings a mix of symptoms collectively called premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. These can range from fatigue, backache, minor mood swings, and usually clear up a day or two into the period. However, about 5% of women experience far more severe condition called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD. Let\u2019s find out more about what PMDD is, how it differs from PMS, and how to manage its symptoms. While the exact reason for PMDD is yet to be discovered, studies have pointed to certain potential causes. A recent research conducted by the National Institute of Health (NIH) found that the cells from women suffering from PMDD react differently (and more sensitively) to fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels than in women without PMDD. This heightened sensitivity affects the brain\u2019s chemical and neurological pathways that regulate the mood and feeling of well-being, possibly leading to depression around period. Since a woman\u2019s reproductive hormone levels change from two weeks leading up to menstruation, this is the time period is when PMDD affected women experience their symptoms. PMDD is a mix of severe physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms that can make daily life very difficult for those who suffer from it. Typically, PMDD symptoms show up in the second half of the menstrual cycle (also called the luteal phase) - around 7 to 10 days before the period, and continue up till menstruation. PMDD has been included as a \u2018depressive disorder not otherwise specified\u2019 by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, or DSM. According to DSM-V manual, a person suffering from PMDD will show at least five of the following key symptoms: Since PMDD is tied to fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels, the above symptoms should be absent for at least a week after periods for PMDD to be diagnosed. If the above symptoms are not cyclical and do not seem to clear up at any time, it may point to another form of underlying depressive disorder. Before diagnosis, it is also important to make sure that these symptoms are not the result of taking medication or oral contraceptives. While both PMS and PMDD symptoms share similarities and show up 7-10 days before periods. What differentiates the two is the severity of the symptoms experienced.\u00a0 PMDD is a more severe form of PMS, where the emotional and physical symptoms are so extreme that they make daily functioning nearly impossible. Here is a handy guide to compare the symptoms of each at a glance: Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant If you experience anxiety and severe depression before period, know that you are not alone and that there is a biological basis for your condition. Often, women are told that their PMDD symptoms are imaginary, whereas numerous studies and research has clearly proved otherwise. A combination of the following suggested treatments can potentially help manage and ease the severity of your symptoms: Keep a track of each of your symptoms each month, their severity (on a scale of 1-10) and on which days they occur via a daily log. This exercise is very helpful in helping your doctor diagnose PMDD, and will also help you predict the days on which you are most likely to experience symptoms. This will make sure you are not caught off guard, and can help prepare for them. In a study conducted amongst 118 women with PMDD, having chasteberry and calcium supplements was shown to significantly improve premenstrual symptoms. Being natural and not chemical based is a clear benefit, and can be added as a natural treatment to your diet to alleviate symptoms. Use of certain hormonal birth control methods is a possible way to treat PMDD symptoms. Hormonal birth control pills release a steady dose of reproductive hormones in the body throughout the cycle, which makes your hormone levels more predictable and less prone to the fluctuations that trigger PMDD symptoms. It is advisable to consult your doctor before deciding whether to and which hormonal birth control to use for treatment. Small lifestyle changes can go a long way in easing your PMDD symptoms. Regular exercise, getting enough sleep, reducing caffeine and avoiding alcohol and smoking have all been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms. It is also a good idea to avoid stressful and emotional triggers that you\u2019ve known to cause anxiety. Practicing yoga, meditation and other relaxation techniques can also contribute to alleviating your symptoms. Fix an appointment with your doctor to discuss your symptoms at length. Taking at least a two month log of your daily symptoms will also help in understanding the symptoms, their severity and help draw up an accurate diagnosis. Living with PMDD can often feel like a lone struggle, which is why joining a local peer support group or consulting a counsellor can greatly help. Sharing your experiences with those that have gone through the same can be a great source of emotional and mental support. Apart from peer support, reaching out to your loved ones and having them involved goes a long way in reducing relationship strain. If they know what you\u2019re going through, there is a much greater scope of understanding and diffuse potential conflict. Affecting around 2 - 8% of women, PMDD is a mix of severe premenstrual symptoms that are physical, emotional and behavioral in nature. Those suffering from the condition have a much higher sensitivity to the normal monthly fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels. The symptoms range from extreme mood swings, pre-period depression, and sudden disinterest in routine tasks and can make simple daily tasks a struggle. Suggested treatment is a combination of lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, yoga, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and cutting caffeine. Taking chasteberry and calcium supplements, and joining a peer support group or counselling have also been shown alleviate symptoms. It is a good idea to keep a daily track of your symptoms and consult your doctor to discuss your symptoms at length, and decide on the best way to treat and manage the disorder.",

Psychological therapy is a practice that aims to help people understand and manage difficulties in their life by talking with a trained professional. Learn from clinical psychologist Naureen Whittinger about signs that you might need professional help, the most common reasons people seek therapy, and how to find a psychotherapist that fits your needs. Interview has been edited for clarity. Dr. Whittinger says there are many reasons people seek the help of a psychotherapist. Some people go to therapy because they\u2019re finding it difficult to manage their daily activities. Others are motivated by a change in mood or energy levels or in the way they respond to events.\u00a0 \u201cKey changes in mood to look out for are feeling very low or more irritable than usual, worrying excessively, or experiencing panic. Alternatively, your mood might be elevated, making it difficult to concentrate or rest,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger. \u201cYour mood is linked closely with your physical well-being, so you might also notice changes in how you feel in your body \u2014 for example, not sleeping easily at night, feeling very tired even though you have rested, or changes in your eating patterns like losing your appetite or eating too much.\u201d\u00a0 She explains that the type of thoughts you have can point to your mental state. Things worth noting are racing thoughts, being preoccupied, difficulty concentrating, or finding it hard to notice anything positive.\u00a0 Relationship changes can be another sign: being more easily upset by others, having frequent arguments, withdrawing from others, or being afraid of being alone.\u00a0 Dr. Whittinger says that these signs are often normal reactions to difficult experiences. They may go away with time or with the support of friends and family. However, if problems like these persist for weeks, there\u2019s no need to go through it alone. \u201cTherapy can provide a helpful space to talk and find new solutions. If you\u2019re having serious thoughts about ending your life or are harming yourself, you should know there are people who can help you, and it can be crucial to seek professional support,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger. Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant Dr. Whittinger explains that people often begin therapy at times of intense stress, perhaps after a difficult event such as divorce, bereavement, or problems at work. Others begin because they are facing a dilemma in their life and they\u2019re looking for a change.\u00a0 Other people have wanted to go to therapy for a long time because they would like to better understand themselves. \u201cIn life, people, especially women, experience a lot of pressure \u2014 to be perfect and to have the ideal relationship, family, career, and home, and never complain about anything,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder many people experience depression and anxiety, have difficulty regulating their emotions, or use unhealthy coping mechanisms like addiction or self-harm. Therapy can provide a space to consider competing priorities and pressures, as well as relationship patterns that cause pain. It can also help people consider important decisions like when is the right time to start a relationship or a family, or how to move forward after the loss of someone close.\u201d Dr. Whittinger shares her professional experience: \u201cAs a psychological therapist, I notice some mental health concerns, such as eating disorders, are more commonly experienced by women, and there are conditions like postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis which are experienced solely by people who\u2019ve had babies, so mostly women. Women are also more likely to experience gender-based crimes and go to therapy to discuss fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth.\u201d\u00a0 She says that the decision to go to therapy should always be a personal one, and there is no wrong time or reason to start. Dr. Whittinger says that your family doctor or another health care professional can usually refer you to a psychological therapist. This is a good way to find a therapist who is qualified, professional, and ethical. You can also find a therapist through recommendations from friends and family, through community or charity organizations, or from online registries.\u00a0 \u201cAfter you\u2019ve identified a psychological therapist you might like to work with, the first step will be to find out more about how they work and if this fits with what you want,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger. \u201cIf you are accessing therapy through health care professionals or other organizations, you might not be able to choose your therapist, but you can still ask questions about what to expect from therapy.\u201d\u00a0 If you have found a private therapist, Dr. Whittinger advises reading their website or giving them a call to find out more. Ask about the time, place, length of sessions, and how long therapy might last. Make sure you are clear about the costs and any charges for missed appointments and holidays. \u201cWhoever you choose to work with, you should always ensure that they have the appropriate qualifications to work with you and are registered with a professional body. Your therapist should be able to explain more about how they work so you can be better prepared for your first session,\u201d says Dr. Whittinger.\u00a0 Dr. Whittinger says that a good fit is important, so ask yourself if your therapist is someone you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings with.\u00a0 For some people, starting therapy can be tough or feel strange, but it\u2019s important to tell your therapist if there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand about the process or don\u2019t feel comfortable with in the sessions.\u00a0 If you've already made an appointment with a therapist, don't miss this first-time therapy session guide by Dr. Whittinger.",

        "content": "Every piece of content at Flo Health adheres to the highest editorial standards for language, style, and medical accuracy. To learn what we do to deliver the best health and lifestyle insights to you, check out our content review principles. A fear of intimacy can feel like a barrier to close, fulfilling relationships, but there are steps you can take to work through it. A psychologist shares how, along with tips on how to support a partner who has intimacy avoidance. By nature, humans are social creatures. We have an instinct to create close bonds with others and connect intimately on both an emotional and a physical level. In fact, one 40-year study of 182 adults by a New York-based researcher determined that establishing intimacy as a young adult can lead to satisfaction in later life. But what happens when something that comes so naturally to some strikes fear and dread in others?\u00a0 Fear of intimacy, or intimacy avoidance as it\u2019s also known, is described by psychologist Jordan Rullo, PhD, as \u201cthe fear of having close and vulnerable relationships with others, whether that be emotionally, physically, or sexually.\u201d Any fear is a complex issue that exists in the subconscious, making it tricky to overcome. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible. In fact, \u201cif you\u2019re reading this article because you recognize that you yourself have a fear of intimacy, you\u2019re already on the path to overcoming it,\u201d says Rullo. \u201cThe first step in changing an old pattern is awareness that the pattern exists. You can\u2019t change something if you don\u2019t know it exists.\u201d Often, a fear of intimacy is the result of difficult life experiences rather than something you\u2019re born with. \u201cThese factors may include a history of abuse or neglect from caregivers or close people in your life, a fear of being abandoned, or a fear of losing oneself in a relationship or being controlled by others,\u201d explains Rullo. But that\u2019s not to say genetics don\u2019t come into it at all; temperament impacts personality development, which can cause challenges. \u201cThere are also some personality types, such as the avoidant personality, which are characterized by an inability to connect with others. Personalities are believed to be solidified in adulthood, and it\u2019s thought that one\u2019s personality is a combination of genetic and environmental factors,\u201d says the psychologist. Sometimes, other types of fears lie at the root of intimacy avoidance, such as: \u201cIf you have a history of being rejected by loved ones or people important to you, then it makes sense that you\u2019d be afraid of being rejected in the present and future,\u201d says Rullo. This fear can mean that you subconsciously try to avoid closeness with others so they don\u2019t have the chance to reject you in the first place.\u00a0 Feeling afraid that your partner will leave you can often be caused by having previously been abandoned by loved ones or people who were important to you. If this is the case, says Rullo, \u201cit may follow that you\u2019d be afraid of being abandoned in the present and future. You might think, \u2018Why get close to someone? They are just going to leave me anyway.\u2019\u201d In contrast, some people are afraid of being invaded, controlled, or losing themselves in a relationship. This can lead to shutting down or avoiding intimacy to protect yourself from feeling dominated by your partner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t trust your ability to set boundaries and maintain some sense of autonomy, it can be scary to get close to others for the fear that they\u2019ll engulf your life,\u201d explains Rullo. Find out what you can do with our Health Assistant Intimacy avoidance can manifest in many different ways \u2014 and don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that those with a fear of intimacy avoid relationships entirely.\u00a0 \u201cFor some people, their fear of intimacy is so strong that they don\u2019t ever pursue or engage in intimate relationships. For others, the fear is strong and there is an equally strong desire to be in an intimate relationship,\u201d explains Rullo.\u00a0 \u201cEssentially, the fear and the desire for intimacy are in a battle. The part of you that desires intimacy motivates you to engage in a relationship, but the moment there\u2019s conflict or an argument, the fearful side gets loud and tells you to leave or end the relationship.\u201d Loved ones may perceive intimacy avoidance as coldness, indifference, or anger, while inside, you will be feeling afraid. \u201cIf a friendship or relationship gets deeper, you may feel like you\u2019re getting \u2018too close\u2019 and need to pull away,\u201d explains the psychologist. A fear of intimacy can also cause you to: If you start to recognize behavioral patterns that might indicate a fear of intimacy, it\u2019s important to know that they\u2019re possible to overcome. And as psychologist Rullo previously explained, the very fact you\u2019re acknowledging the existence of intimacy issues is the first step to improving your ability to maintain close relationships.\u00a0 Since a fear of intimacy is often rooted in complex emotional issues that can date all the way back to childhood, it may be advisable to consult a mental health professional. \u201cUse your awareness of your fear as motivation to work with a therapist to dive deeper and start to understand where this fear comes from and how to change it,\u201d says Rullo.\u00a0 Therapy, Rullo continues, \u201ccan help you take a step back and observe the fear of intimacy behaviors and patterns that keep repeating themselves. A therapist will ask you questions to dive deeper into the cause of those fearful behaviors, help you gain awareness of when you\u2019re engaging in those behaviors, help you analyze whether those behaviors are rational, and then help you experiment with and create new patterns and behaviors that are more congruent with your value of wanting more intimacy in your life and relationships.\u201d If therapy is not an option for you, there are steps you can take to start overcoming intimacy avoidance on your own, as Rullo explains: \u201cEngage in self-reflection to gain insight as to why you\u2019re feeling that fear. Have you been mistreated by loved ones before? Have you been abandoned or neglected? Do you feel unlovable? It can be helpful to explore what this fear is about for you.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHave compassion for yourself because of what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d Mindful self-compassion is the ability to bring compassion inward the way that we would respond to a friend or small child. Consider what you would say to others and give yourself permission to say that to yourself.\u00a0 \u201cThen start to identify what you want your intimacy to look like. For example, do you want to be closer to others than you are? Do you want to let people in?\u201d \u201cIf you decide you do want more intimacy in your life, start to experiment with small gestures to get closer to others. When your partner hugs you, try to accept the hug a bit longer than usual. When your partner says \u2018I love you,\u2019 try to take that in versus deflect it. Over time, the more you experiment with connecting more deeply with others, the less fearful you\u2019ll become.\u201d Eventually, you may feel safe enough to start opening up to loved ones with conversations about your fear of intimacy. This, in itself, is a very positive step. \u201cTo have a conversation about your fear of intimacy is, in and of itself, an intimate and vulnerable conversation,\u201d Rullo says.\u00a0 \u201cThe key to any healthy conversation is to enter it with a mindset of wanting to understand. Pick a time with privacy and no time pressure. Think about where you can have this conversation where you will feel the least vulnerable. Is it easier to not look your partner in the eyes to have the conversation? Is it easier to write a letter about this fear and share it with your loved one?\u201d Being in a relationship with someone who has intimacy avoidance issues can be just as challenging. Rullo suggests reminding yourself that a fear of intimacy \u201ccan be overcome, and it takes time, insight, compassion, and trust.\u201d Modeling can be a powerful tool in supporting people with a fear of intimacy. Consider sharing emotions and being vulnerable yourself to create this as a norm within the relationship, and give the other person permission to join you in that space when they are ready. Remember that your partner\u2019s reactions to difficult situations really aren\u2019t personal. It\u2019s not about you; it\u2019s about them. Be mindful of that as you support them in their process to work through it and encourage them to engage in self-exploration or therapy to start to understand where this fear comes from. When dealing with a fear of intimacy (either in yourself or in a partner), patience is key. It takes time to overcome years of the deep-rooted insecurities that have created a fear of relationships. With time and guidance from a medical professional and support from loved ones, you can overcome those fears and build strong, healthy, long-lasting relationships with a closeness you might not have previously thought possible.
